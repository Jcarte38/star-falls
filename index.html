<h1>Sudden stars fallen down</h1>
 <p>What a falling star looks like... from space! </p>

 <p>How cool would it be to look down to see a falling star?</p>

 <p>A "falling star" or a "shooting star"<br> 
Has nothing at all to do with a star! <br>
  The region of the sky</p>

As a brief flash of light at a single point in the sky–<br> 
 rather than the usual streak of light we associate with shooting.

A meteor shower is a spike in the number of meteors or "shooting stars" that streak through the night sky.<br>
 Look for state or city parks or other safe, dark sites.

 <p>Points of light that seem not to move… but suddenly, without warning, we see what looks like a star falling at full.</p>

<p>Most people know you can see the occasional meteor streaking across the sky on any given night.<br>
 Many might call it a shooting star, though ...</p>
